# Problem Identified
Finding food trends and associated restaurants are quite hard to find on social media. Finding the restaurant name, location, what time they are open, do they take bookings, how much does the food cost and what others have said about the restaurant require more research on the User’s part. Furthermore, if for some reason, you can’t get to the restaurant from the post, then how about another restaurant that serves the same food. 

It’s often a multi-step process from finding a food trend to booking the restaurant, and that’s what our app aims to address. 

---

# Purpose 

RoondayView is a Web application that aims to make trending dishes more visible to users’ specific food interests. Users are able to see trending (ranked) dishes as well as the restaurants that serve the specific dish. This saves time for users, as the restaurant profile is readily available. It removes the extra steps and time that users would normally invest to find a specific dish and restaurant.
